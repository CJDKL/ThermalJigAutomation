# ThermalJig-Automation

This project aims to simplify the testing process by changing the way the technicians tests thermal equipment. Previously, the technician would manually adjust the temperature on the controller and time the process; however, with this project, the program would run the process automatically and all the technician will have to do is to set the parameters of the test.

The project is done in C# and connects to the controller via the Modbus Protocol (RS-232). A functional GUI is also implemented to display 2 graphs for testing purposes. The temperature of the thermal equipments are also automatically logged in to the computer.

The automation aspect of the project increased the efficiency of the tests by eliminating potential human error. Each thermal equipment's data needed to be manually logged, but that is no longer the case. Automated data collection helps the lab to ensure the quality of the tests, especially to the customers who buy the equipments.

Finally, some testing procedure and default test parameters have been modified to erase sensitive information.
